1- for the day 4 and day 3 assignments convert all the programs to functions

2- write a Python function which takes a positive number as input and return the factorial of the number.

3- Write a Python function that accepts a string and counts the number of upper and lower case letters.
Sample String : 'The quick Brow Fox'
Expected Output :
No. of Upper case characters : 3
No. of Lower case Characters : 12

4- Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with distinct elements from the first list.
Sample List : [1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

5- Write a Python function that checks whether a passed string is a palindrome or not.
Note: A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam.

6- Write a Python program that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
Sample Items : green-red-yellow-black-white
Expected Result : black-green-red-white-yellow

7- write a python function that accepts a string and prints the count of occurence of each characters
sample string: aabccda
expected result:
a -> 3
b-> 1
c-> 2
d -> 1

8- write a function called is_prime that takes an integer as an argument and returns True if it is a prime number, and False otherwise.

9- write a function called generate_fibonacci that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.

10- Write a function called capitalize_odd_letters that takes a string as input and returns the same string with the odd-indexed letters capitalized.

11- write a function called find_common_elements that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing the common elements between the two lists.
