# 4- Let say You have one 100 cats.
# One day, you decide to arrange all your cats in a giant circle. Initially,none of your cats has a hat on.
# You walk around the circle a 100 times, always starting with the first cat (cat #1).
# Each time you stop at a cat, you check if it has a hat on. If it doesn’t, then you put a hat on it.
# If it does, then you take the hat off.
#
# 1. The first round, you stop at every cat, placing a hat on each one.
# 2. The second round, you stop only at every second cat (#2, #4, #6,
# #8, and so on).
# 3. The third round, you stop only at every third cat (#3, #6, #9, #12,
# and so on).
# 4. You continue this process until you’ve made one hundred rounds
# around the cats. On the last round, you stop only at cat #100.
#
#
# Write a program that simply outputs which cats have hats at the end.
